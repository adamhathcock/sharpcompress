# SharpCompress

SharpCompress is a compression library in pure C# for .NET 3.5, 4.5, .NET Standard 1.0, 1.3 that can unrar, un7zip, unzip, untar unbzip2 and ungzip with forward-only reading and file random access APIs. Write support for zip/tar/bzip2/gzip are implemented.

The major feature is support for non-seekable streams so large files can be processed on the fly (i.e. download stream).

Check the [Supported Formats](FORMATS.md) and [Basic Usage.](USAGE.md)

## Recommended Formats

In general, I recommend GZip (Deflate)/BZip2 (BZip)/LZip (LZMA) as the simplicity of the formats lend to better long term archival as well as the streamability. Tar is often used in conjunction for multiple files in a single archive (e.g. `.tar.gz`)

Zip is okay, but it's a very hap-hazard format and the variation in headers and implementations makes it hard to get correct. Uses Deflate by default but supports a lot of compression methods.

RAR is not recommended as it's a propriatory format and the compression is closed source. Use Tar/LZip for LZMA

7Zip and XZ both are overly complicated. 7Zip does not support streamable formats. XZ has known holes explained here: (http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/xz_inadequate.html) Use Tar/LZip for LZMA compression instead.

## A Simple Request

Hi everyone. I hope you're using SharpCompress and finding it useful. Please give me feedback on what you'd like to see changed especially as far as usability goes. New feature suggestions are always welcome as well. I would also like to know what projects SharpCompress is being used in. I like seeing how it is used to give me ideas for future versions. Thanks!

Please do not email me directly to ask for help. If you think there is a real issue, please report it here.

## Want to contribute?

I'm always looking for help or ideas. Please submit code or email with ideas. Unfortunately, just letting me know you'd like to help is not enough because I really have no overall plan of what needs to be done. I'll definitely accept code submissions and add you as a member of the project!

## TODOs (always lots)

* RAR 5 decryption support
* 7Zip writing
* Zip64 (Need writing and extend Reading)
* Multi-volume Zip support.
